POWERBI DASHBOARD
For the dashboard, I used Power BI tool. The dashboard was designed to be intuitive and interactive, allowing stakeholders to drill down into specific data points. Key features included:
•	Sales Overview: A high-level view of total sales and order volume over time.
•	Product Performance: Visualizations highlighting top-selling products and categories.
•	Customer Insights: Segmentation analysis showing customer demographics and purchasing patterns.
•	Geographical Sales Distribution: Maps displaying sales performance across different regions.
